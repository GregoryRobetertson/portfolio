I used Firebase for auth and MongoDB for data. One challenge I faced was a redirect URI mismatch error during Google login, which I fixed by properly configuring the credentials in Google Cloud. The result: a fast, clean, and seamless user experience."

The frontend is built with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and a sprinkle of Bootstrap for structure and styling. On the backend, I used Node.js and Express to create a RESTful API that handles products, cart management, and the entire checkout process. Getting the API and frontend to stay in sync was a solid challenge, but it taught me a lot about building real-world, full-stack apps from scratch."
